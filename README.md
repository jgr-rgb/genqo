# genqo: A hybrid gaussian/non-gaussian quantum optics engine

## Background
genqo was developed with the primary purpose of modeling entanglement distribution sources, such as the ZALM source (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03670). But, the techniques used are generally applicable to systems where modeling the quantum state can benefit from both gaussian (CV) and non-gaussian (DC) quantum optics formalism.
